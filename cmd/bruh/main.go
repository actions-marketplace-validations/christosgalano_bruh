/*
bruh (Bicep Resource Update Helper) is a command-line tool for updating the API version of Azure resources in Bicep files.

It offers two main commands: scan and update.

The scan command parses the given bicep file or directory, fetches the latest API versions for each Azure resource referenced in the file(s),
and prints the results to stdout. For full usage details, run "bruh scan --help" or "bruh help scan".

The update command parses the given bicep file or directory, fetches the latest API versions for each Azure resource referenced in the file(s),
and updates the file(s) in place or creates new ones with the "_updated.bicep" extension.
For full usage details, run "bruh update --help" or "bruh help update"

All the API versions are fetched from the official Microsoft learn website (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/templates/).
